# Game Party Helper (WIP)

Little Application, using numerical steam ids, for comparing the libraries of
multiple steam users to decide what to play

# What will be added
 - Convert steam id to persona name in the list
 - Convert game ids to their titles in the result list
 - Generally nicer-looking UI
 - Optionally slim game list down to multiplayer games
